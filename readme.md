## Visual Studio Code (the terminal)
To run these tests in the terminal, do the following:
- Open your terminal and navigate to this directory.
- Use the command **npm install** to download and install the dependencies.
- Run the tests using **npm test**.

If you get tired of reading the tests results in the terminal, then try this very nice web-based GUI:

- Run the tests using **npx majestic**.

## WebStorm
To run these tests in WebStorm, do the following:

- Use your terminal and navigate to this directory.
- Use the command **npm install** to get the dependencies.
- Right click **TheCode.test.js** and choose **Run**.

You should now see the results of the tests in the built-in WebStorm test runner. Very nice! Of course, you can still run them in the terminal or using majestic as described above.

## Note
Always do *npm install* in all examples before running the code. Whenever you see a *package.json* file, run *npm install* as the first thing :)
